# Project 20: PPC Campaign Performance Analysis

## Description
This project analyzes Pay-Per-Click (PPC) campaign data to optimize ad performance, focusing on key metrics such as Click-Through Rate (CTR), Conversion Rate, and Return on Investment (ROI). The goal is to improve campaign targeting, budgeting, and overall effectiveness.

## Objectives
- Analyze PPC campaign performance using exploratory data analysis.
- Build and evaluate a Random Forest model to predict conversion likelihood.
- Provide actionable insights for optimizing ad performance.

## Methodology
1. **Data Collection:** Synthetic PPC data was generated with key variables.
2. **Data Cleaning:** Ensured data consistency and accuracy.
3. **Exploratory Analysis:** Analyzed metrics such as CTR, Conversion Rate, and ROI.
4. **Modeling:** Trained a Random Forest model to predict conversion likelihood.
5. **Recommendations:** Provided insights for improving campaign strategies.

## Results
- Achieved an accuracy of 80% with the Random Forest model.
- Identified high-performing keywords and recommended bid adjustments.
